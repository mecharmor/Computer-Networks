* Multithreaded Client/Server TCP Message APP With Primitive Sockets
* Description: TCP Client/Server app that uses the socket library in python to develop a server and client class that utilize these sockets in
talking with one another.
* Purpose: The purpose of this assignment is to better understand the TCP protocol with implementation of sockets and threading.
* Clear instructions about how to clone/download/install/execute the project
    * to clone the project go to Terminal (OSX/Linux) and type `git clone https://github.com/sfsu-joseo/csc645-01-fall2019-projects-mecharmor`
    * navigate to directory /applications/tcp-message-app/ or view this repo at URL: https://github.com/sfsu-joseo/csc645-01-fall2019-projects-mecharmor/tree/master/applications/tcp-message-app
    * once you are in the directory you can either double click the server.py and client.py or you can launch these in terminal by using the command 
    `python server.py` and `python client.py`. (Note: you must be in the directory of these files to launch)
    * WARNING: It is crucial that you start the server.py BEFORE the client.py. (For testing I used IP: `localhost`, and PORT: `8008`)

* Compatibility issues
* A paragrah or two about what challenges you have faced in this assignment, and what you have learned from it.
