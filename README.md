This is your individual private repository for this class. As the owner of this repo, you have total admin permissions over the data hosted here. Please, use them carefully!

Please do the following steps before starting your first assigment

Normally, once the repository is created, it will have your GitHub username. But, if you see the instructor's github username in your repository name, please change it. All that needs to change is the the instructor's github username 'joseortizcostadev' to your respective Github username 

Please follow carefully the naming convention assigned by your instructor. Automated scripts are used in your repositories for grading purposes. If your repository name does not follow the guidelines established above, then your repository may not become visible for grading. 

NO code needs to be stored in the root of your repository. You may rename the applications folder if you like, and all its subfolders. But all source code related to your assignments should be stored inside the applications folder organized in folders with the name of each of your assignments. For instance, if you are working in assignment #1, then the folder structure should be similar to this: /applications/tcp-message-app/

Each programming assignment folder should contain its own README.md file. It should, at least, contain the following documentation, but you are free to add more sections:
   * Your name and student id
   * Project name 
   * Project description
   * Project purpose
   * Clear instructions about how to clone/download/install/execute the project
   * Compatibility issues 
   * A paragrah or two about what challenges you have faced in this assignment, and what you have learned from it.
